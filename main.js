// Using the global items variable created in items.js, use array.map(), array.reduce(), array.forEach(), and array.filter() to help you through the assignment questions
// The answers should be logged out to your console using console.log()
// Make sure the output matches the answers below each question
// Please comment your code as you walk through your process
// It is suggested that you write functions that return values, not just functions that call console.log


// 1. Show me how to calculate the average price of all items. Please console.log the average.
// Answer: $23.63


const prices = items.map(function(number){
    return (number['price']);
});
// console.log(prices);

const totalPrices = function(acc, val) {
    return acc + val
}; 

const answerIs = (prices.reduce(totalPrices)/prices.length);

console.log("The average price is " + answerIs.toFixed(2));


// 2.Show me how to get an array of items that cost between $14.00 and $18.00 USD. Please console.log the answer.


const newList = items.filter(function(item){
    return item.price < 18 && item.price >= 14; 
});

console.log("Items that cost between $14.00 USD and $18.00 USD:", newList);

// newList.forEach(function(item){
//     console.log(`Items that cost between $14.00 USD and $18.00 USD: ${item}`);
// });


// 3. Show me how find the item with a "GBP" currency code and print its name and price. Please console.log the one you find.

// function isEuro(item) {
//     return item.currency_code === "GBP";  //this would work BUT it's less dynamic (wouldn't work if there were multiple instances in the array)
// }
// console.log(items.find(isEuro));

const GBPItems = items.filter(function(item) {
    return item.currency_code === "GBP";
});

GBPItems.forEach(function(item) {
    console.log(`${item.title} costs ${item.price}Â£.`);
});

 //CONSOLE LOG IN CORRECT FORMAT ---- use forEach?


// 4. Show me how to find which items are made of wood. Please console.log the ones you find.

const areWood = items.filter(function(element){
    return element.materials.includes("wood");
});

areWood.forEach(function(item){
    console.log(`${item.title} is made of wood.`);
});


//5. Show me how to find which items are made of eight or more materials. Please console.log the ones you find.

const eightPlus = items.filter(function(item) {
    return item.materials.length > 8;
});
    // console.dir(eightPlus);

eightPlus.forEach(function(item){
    console.log(`${item.title} has ${item.materials.length}: ${item.materials}`);
})



//6. Show me how to calculate how many items were made by their sellers. Please console.log your answer.

const whoMadeIt = items.filter(function(element){
    return element.who_made.includes("i_did");
});

 console.log(`${whoMadeIt.length}` + " were made by their sellers.");
